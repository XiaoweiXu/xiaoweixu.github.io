                            Blur detection is the separation of blurred and clear regions
                                of an image, which is an important and challenging task in computer
                                vision. In this work, we regard blur detection as an image segmentation problem.</p>

                                The MSDU-net uses a
                                    group of multi-scale feature extractors with dilated convolutions to extract texture information at different scales. The U-shape architecture
                                    of the MSDU-net fuses the different-scale texture features and generates
                                    a semantic feature which allows us to achieve better results on the blur
                                    detection task.    </p>

                        <p> <span class="label label-default">extensive/intensive</span> 
                            </p>In this paper, we aim at solving pixel-wise binary
                            problems, including salient object segmentation, skeleton extraction, and edge detection, by introducing a general architecture.

                            </p>In particular, we introduce a horizontal
                            cascade of encoders so as to gradually advance the feature
                            representations from the original CNN trunks. To better fuse
                            feature at different levels, the inputs of each encoder in our
                            architecture is densely connected to the outputs of its previous
                            encoder.
                            </p>Stringing these encoders together allows us to effectively
                            exploit features across different levels hierarchically to effectively
                            address multiple pixel-wise binary regression tasks. 
                            </p>Existing works: What they have in common is that each layer in the decoder (the
                            right part of each diagram in Fig. 2) can only receive features
                            from the backbone or its upper layers in the decoder. These
                            types of designs may work well for salient object detection
                            but may fail when applied to edge detection and skeleton
                            extraction (and vice versa). The fundamental reason behind
                            this is the fact that the feature representations formed in the
                            decoders are not powerful enough to deal with all of these
                            tasks.

                        This is NOT a multi-task framework, but one which can be used for only one of these tasks.
                        </p> Good writing. Nice related work, and detailed motivation.

                                semantic segmentation
    
                                </p>Our Dual Graph Convolutional Network (DGCNet) models the global
                                context of the input feature by modelling two orthogonal graphs in a single framework.
                                The first component models spatial relationships between pixels in the image, whilst the
                                second models interdependencies along the channel dimensions of the network’s feature
                                map. This is done efficiently by projecting the feature into a new, lower-dimensional
                                space where all pairwise interactions can be modelled, before reprojecting into the original
                                space. Code and models are made available to foster any further research
                                (https://github.com/lxtGH/GALD-DGCNet).

                                </p>Current state-of-the-art methods are all based on deep learning using fully convolutional
                                networks (FCNs) [32]. However, <b>the receptive field of an FCN grows slowly (only linearly)
                                with increasing depth in the network, and its limited receptive field is not able to capture
                                longer-range relationships between pixels in an image. Dilated convolutions [4, 49] have
                                been proposed to remedy this. However, the resulting feature representation is dominated by
                                large objects in the image, and consequently, performance on small objects is poor</b>. Another
                                direction has been to fuse multiscale features within the network [17, 31, 55] or to use LSTMs
                                to propagate information spatially [3, 40]. Recently, several methods based on self-attention
                                [14, 24, 43, 50] have also been used to learn an affinity map at each spatial position that
                                propagates information to its neighbours. However, the memory requirements of the large
                                affinity matrix renders these methods unsuitable for high resolution imagery.

                                </p> GCNs have recently been
                                applied to scene understanding tasks [8, 25, 26, 53], as they are able to globally propagate
                                information through the whole image in a manner that is conditional on the input.

                                </p>

                                physiological functions of the human body.

                                </p>A tubular structure can be well represented by its
                                skeleton and the cross-sectional radius of each skeleton point.
    
                                </p>we propose to perform tubular structure segmentation by training a multitask deep network to predict not only a segmentation mask
                                for a tubular structure, but also a distance map, consisting
                                of the distance transform value from each tubular structure
                                voxel to the tubular structure surface, rather than a single skeleton/non-skeleton label
                                </p>We further quantize each dv into one of K bins by rounding dv to the nearest integer.  We do this quantization, because
                                training a deep network directly for regression is relatively
                                unstable, since outliers, i.e., the commonly existed annotation errors for medical images [41], cause a large error term,
                                which makes it difficult for the network to converge and
                                leads to unstable predictions.

                                    </p>An alternative network architecture is to restrict the
                                    decoder and encoder to spatial domain while capturing a
                                    temporal signature in the encoding space, see Figure 2. Such
                                    an architecture can be accomplished as a combination of
                                    standard LSTM cells with spatial encoders and decoders
                                    which are commonly employed in semantic segmentation
                                    tasks such as DeConvNet [5] and SegNet [6]. With this
                                    architecture, temporal relations in the final high-level
                                    encoding space are captured by the recurrent structure.
                                    Such a network would cover use cases where the nature of
                                    temporal phenomena builds upon high abstractive concepts. 
        
                                    </p>However, in our use case, the shape of the plume is not
                                    semantically meaningful, has low abstraction, high texture
                                    and changes from frame to frame with no consistency across
                                    different exemplar plumes. This phenomenon suggests
                                    using a spatio-temporal encoder-decoder scheme as
                                    proposed in this paper which can capture and isolate
                                    lower-level patterns.

                                </p>In our work, co-training is achieved
                                by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data.
    
                                </p>We
                                generate different views by rotating or permuting the 3D
                                data and utilize asymmetrical 3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In addition, we
                                propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism
                                to estimate the reliability of each view’s prediction with
                                Bayesian deep learning. As one view requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our self-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of
                                each unlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo
                                label.
                                </p>Inspired by the success of co-training [5] and its extension
                                into single 2D images [30], we further extend this idea
                                into 3D.
                                </p>Typical co-training requires at least two views (i.e.
                                sources) of data, either of which should be sufficient to train
                                a classifier on. Co-training minimizes the disagreements by
                                assigning pseudo labels between each other view on unlabeled data.
                                </p>For unlabeled data, we construct a co-training assumption under a semi-supervised setting. The co-training strategy assumes the prediction on each view should reach a
                                consensus. So the prediction of each model can act as a
                                pseudo label to supervise other views in order to learn from
                                unlabeled data.
                                </p>Successful co-training: 1. Since most computer vision tasks have only one source of data, encouraging view differences is a crucial point for successful cotraining. 2. Another aspect of
                                co-training to emphasize is view confidence estimation. In
                                multi-view settings, given sufficient variance of each view,
                                the quality of each prediction is not guaranteed and bad
                                pseudo labels can be harmful if used in the training process.
                                </p>We further introduce the <b>model-level view differences</b>
                                by adopting 2D pre-trained models to asymmetric kernels
                                in 3D networks, such as 3 × 3 × 1 kernels. 
                                </p>Another key component is the view confidence estimation. We propose to estimate the uncertainty of each view’s
                                prediction with <b>Bayesian deep networks</b> by adding dropout into the architectures [13].
                                </p>Asymmetric 3D kernels and 2D initialization. The cotraining assumption encourages models to make similar predictions on both S and U, which potentially can lead to collapsed neural networks mentioned in [30]. To address this
                                problem, we further encourage view difference at feature
                                level by designing a task-specific model. We propose to
                                use asymmetric 3D models initialized with 2D pre-trained
                                weights as the backbone network of each view to encourage diverse features for each view learning.

                                effective approach for image segmentation when annotated data
                                is scarce.
    
                                </p>In this paper, we improve existing approaches for semisupervised segmentation with a self-paced and self-consistent cotraining method. 
                                </p>To help distillate information from unlabeled
                                images, we first design a self-paced learning strategy for cotraining that lets jointly-trained neural networks focus on easierto-segment regions first, and then gradually consider harder ones.
                                This is achieved via an end-to-end differentiable loss in the form
                                of a generalized Jensen Shannon Divergence (JSD).
                                </p>Moreover,
                                to encourage predictions from different networks to be both
                                consistent and confident, we enhance this generalized JSD loss
                                with an uncertainty regularizer based on entropy. The robustness
                                of individual models is further improved using a self-ensembling
                                loss that enforces their prediction to be consistent across different
                                training iterations.
                                </p>Existing methods do not employ a self-paced learning strategy and
                                therefore are susceptible to incorrect predictions in initial
                                stages of training.
                                </p>Existing methods do not exploit self-consistency
                                within the model. While co-training promotes consistency across different
                                models, it has also been shown that imposing consistency
                                between the predictions of a single model at different training
                                iterations can also improve its robustness in a semi-supervised
                                setting [27]. Based on this idea, we propose to incorporate
                                a self-ensembling strategy in our co-training method, where
                                we replace each segmentation model f

                                . The two models share
                                the same architecture, however the Teacher’s parameters are a

                                therefore, be considered as a special case of ensemble learning [99], where instead of training
                                one single model, a set of models is trained and their predictions are aggregated.

                                </p>The general idea of GCN: For each node, we get the feature information from all its neighbors and of course, 
                                the feature of itself. Assume we use the average() function. We will do the same for all the nodes. Finally, 
                                we feed these average values into a neural network.
                                </p>Instead of the sum() function, we need to take the average, or even better, the weighted average of neighbors’ feature vectors. 
                                <b>Why don’t we use the sum() function?</b> The reason is that when using the sum() function, high-degree nodes are likely to have huge v vectors, 
                                while low-degree nodes tend to get small aggregate vectors, which may later cause exploding or vanishing gradients (e.g., when using sigmoid). 
                                Besides, Neural networks seem to be sensitive to the scale of input data. Thus, we need to normalize these vectors to get rid of the potential issues.
                                </p>For <b>matrix scaling</b>, we usually multiply the matrix by a diagonal matrix. In this case, we want to take the average of the sum feature, 
                                or mathematically, to scale the sum vector matrix ÃX according to the node degrees. The gut feeling tells us that our diagonal matrix used to scale
                                here is something related to the Degree matrix 
                                </p>The number of layers is the farthest distance that node features can travel. For example, with 1 layer GCN, each node can only get the information
                                from its neighbors. The gathering information process takes place independently, at the same time for all the nodes.
                                </p>We can stack more layers to make GCNs deeper. Consider residual connections for deep GCNs. Normally, we go for 2 or 3-layer GCN.
                                </p>GCNs are used for semi-supervised learning on the graph.
                                </p>GCNs use both node features and the structure for the training. 
                                </p>The main idea of the GCN is to take the weighted average of all neighbors’ node features (including itself): Lower-degree nodes get larger weights. Then, we pass the resulting feature vectors through a neural network for training.
                                </p>Maths Note: When seeing a diagonal matrix, think of matrix scaling.

                                recourse is the art of statistical inference: we either make up a prior (Bayesian) or do our
                                best using only the likelihood (frequentist).
    
                                </p>The Bayesian school models uncertainty by a probability distribution over hypotheses.
                                One’s ability to make inferences depends on one’s degree of confidence in the chosen prior,
                                and the robustness of the findings to alternate prior distributions may be relevant and
                                important.
                                </p>The frequentist school only uses conditional distributions of data given specific hypotheses.
                                The presumption is that some hypothesis (parameter specifying the conditional distribution
                                of the data) is true and that the observed data is sampled from that distribution. In
                                particular, the frequentist approach does not depend on a subjective prior that may vary
                                from one investigator to another.
                                </p>Frequentist measures like p-values and confidence intervals continue to dominate research,
                                especially in the life sciences. However, in the current era of powerful computers and
                                big data, Bayesian methods have undergone an enormous renaissance in fields like machine learning and genetics. There are now a number of large, ongoing clinical trials using
                                Bayesian protocols, something that would have been hard to imagine a generation ago.
                                While professional divisions remain, the consensus forming among top statisticians is that

                                </p>In general, compared to the earlier fusion, the later fusion can achieve better segmentation performance if the fusion method is ffective enough. And the selection of fusion method depends on the specific problem.
                                </p>The isolated segmentation labels with small size are prone to artefacts and the largest volume are usually kept in the final segmentation. 
                                </p> <b>Input-level fusion network</b>: By using the input-level fusion strategy, the rich feature information from different modalities can be fully exploited in all layers, from the first layer to the last one. 
                                This kind of fusion uses usually four techniques, multi-task segmentation, multi-view segmentation, multi-scale segmentation and GAN-based segmentation.
                                
                                </p>Based on curriculum learning [58], which means gradually increasing the difficulty of training tasks, they applied an effective strategy to improve the convergence quality of the model by training the first task only
                                 until the loss curve tends to flatten, then the first data and the second data are concatenated along the batch dimension as the input for the second task. The operation of the third task is like the second
                                  one. In this way, not only the model parameters but also the training data are transferred from an easier task to a more difficult task. 
                                </p>Qin et al. [43] proposed the autofocus convolutional layer to enhance the abilities of neural networks by using multi-scale processing. 
                                  After integrating the multi-modal images in the input space, they applied an autofocus
                                   convolutional layer by using multiple convolutional layers with different dilation rates to change the size of the receptive field. Autofocus convolutional layer can indicate the importance of each scale when processing different locations of an image. 
                                </p> <b>Layer-level fusion</b>: single or two modal images are used as the single input to train individual segmentation network, and then these learned individual 
                                feature representations will be fused in the layers of the network, finally the fused result will be fed to the decision layer to obtain the final segmentation result. 
                                in the layer-level fusion segmentation network, <b>DenseNets are the commonly used networks which bring the three following benefits</b>. First, direct connections between all 
                                layers help to improve the flow of information and gradients through the entire network, alleviating the problem of vanishing gradient. Second, short paths to all the feature 
                                maps in the architecture introduce implicit deep supervision. Third, dense connections have a regularizing effect, which reduces the risk of over-fitting 
                                on tasks with smaller training sets. Therefore, DenseNets allow to improved effectiveness and efficiency in the layer-level fusion segmentation network.
                                </p>The later fusion can achieve better performance, because each modality is employed as input of one network which can learn complex and complementary feature information compared to input-level fusion network.
                                </p>Publicly available multi-modal medical image datasets for segmentation task are rare, the most used dataset is the BraTS dataset having proposed since 2012. 
                                </p>The authors demonstrate that more sophisticated data augmentation techniques, data post-processing techniques, or deeper network will not further improve the network performance, 
                                    which means the network architecture plays a crucial role in the segmentation network than other data processing operations.
                                </p><b>Deep learning-based methods outperform in three aspects</b>. First, deep learning-based networks learn a complex and abstract hierarchical 
                                feature representation for image data to overcome the difficulty of manual feature design. Second, deep learning-based networks can present the complex
                                 relationships between different modalities by using the hierarchical network layer, such as the layer-level fusion strategy. Third, the image transform and fusion
                                  strategy in the conventional fusion strategy can be jointly generated by training a deep learning model, in this way some potential deep learning network
                                   architectures can be investigated for designing an effective image fusion strategy. 
                                Therefore, the deep learning-based method has a great potential to produce better fusion results than conventional methods.
                                </p>Compared the last two fusion strategies, the layer fusion strategy seems better, since the dense connection among the layers can exploit more
                                 complex and complementary information to enhance the network training, while the decision-level fusion only learns the independent feature representation in single modality.
                                </p>Havaei, et al. [19] proposes a two-phase training procedure. It first constructs a patch dataset such that all labels are <b>equiprobable</b> by taking 
                                 into account the diversity in all classes, and then retrains only the output layer to calibrate the output probabilities correctly. In this way, the class imbalance problem is overcome.
